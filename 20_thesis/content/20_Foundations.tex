\section{Neglected Tropical Diseases}
\label{sec:Foundations:NTDs}

\ac{NTDs} \cite{feasey2010neglected} are a biologically diverse group of diseases which mainly occur in tropical regions. The geographic location, however, is not linked to temperatures or climate but mainly as a result of a large part of the world's poorest population living in these regions. \ac{NTDs} affect approximately a sixth of the world population, yet, they have received less attention than other diseases. \textcite{feasey2010neglected} state that there are \ac{NTDs} which have a high prevalence and excellent potential for successful control. Among these are Ascaris, Hookworm, Whipworm, and Schistosoma. These parasites are the ones present in the dataset used in this thesis. Ascaris, Hookworm and Whipworm are \ac{STHs} which is a subclass of \ac{NTDs}\todo{Source for subclass}.

\subsection{\acl{STHs}}
\label{sec:Foundations:NTDs:STHs}

Helminthic parasites which are mainly transmitted through soil are known as \acl{STHs} \cite{feasey2010neglected,jourdan2018soiltransmitted}. 

\ac{STHs} are as implied by the name 


This section gives a more detailed introduction into \ac{STHs} present in the dataset used.

\todo{there are additional STHs: Strongyloides stercoralis}

\subsection{Schistosoma}
\label{sec:Foundations:NTDs:STHs:Schistosoma}

Schistosoma are, unlike \ac{STHs}, not transmitted through soil.  \todo{Write section for schistosoma}

The diseases mentioned in \autoref{sec:Foundations:NTDs:STHs} are commonly diagnosed \todo{finish how to diagnose including sources}
