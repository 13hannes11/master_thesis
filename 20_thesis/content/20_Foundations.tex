\label{sec:Foundations:NTDs}

\ac{NTDs} are a biologically diverse group of diseases which mainly occur in tropical regions \cite{feasey2010neglected}. The geographic location, however, is not linked to temperatures or climate but mainly as a result of a large part of the world's poorest population living in these regions. \ac{NTDs} affect approximately a sixth of the world population, yet, they have received less attention than other diseases.

\ac{STHs} and Schistosoma are subclasses of \ac{NTDs} which consists of \todo{source for STHs}
