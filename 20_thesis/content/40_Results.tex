\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:Results}

In this chapter, different metrics to show the performance of models when predicting the distance to the focal plane are discussed. Further, the prediction behaviour of two models is presented. This is followed by comparing traditional focus metrics to the trained models based on the ability to select the in-focus image of a focus stack. In addition, additional uses of models like the creation of a focus distance heatmap, the creation of a stitched image, and the creation of a contour plot to show the height characteristics of a sample are presented. Lastly, the speed and memory consumption is analysed.



\section{Focus Distance Prediction}
\label{sec:Results:FocusDistance}

When the task is to estimate the distance or offset to the best focus value \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 performs best, followed by \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-101 and \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-18 (refer to \autoref{tab:Results:Models:Accuracy}). \Acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 reaches an \ac{mae} of $0.0056$ which is an average error of less than one image in a focus stack (approximately $0.007$). Further, the \ac{srcc} and \ac{plcc} are above $0.9$ thereby showing a strong correlation. The \ac{r2} score of $0.86$ supports this as well.
The worst performing model is \acs{poop}-\acs{fc} with most metrics lying below $0.04$ except \ac{srcc} with a value of $0.12$. This model shows no direct correlation with the focus input data. The \acs{poop}-\acs{cnn}'s \ac{mae} is only slightly worse than \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet} models. It shows still some good correlation for \ac{srcc} and \ac{plcc}, however, the \ac{r2} score is just below $0.70$.

\autoref{fig:Results:ScatterPredictedTarget} shows the predictions in comparison to the targeted values when using \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 and \acs{poop}-\acs{cnn}. The plot for \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 (\autoref{fig:Results:ScatterPredictedTarget:ResNet34}) shows a line that represents the ideal match between targets and predictions. The data points in the plot clearly follow this line, they, however, have an approximate spread of 0.01 across most predictions. When a target range close to zero is reached the observed vertical spread is larger. Negative predictions also mostly correspond to negative targets. Further, one outlier can be seen with a target value of smaller than $-0.08$ and one with a target value of smaller than $-0.05$. Additional outliers are seen across the whole plot which increase the spread quite substantially. The outliers seen in \autoref{fig:Results:ScatterPredictedTarget:ResNet34} can also be observed in \autoref{fig:Results:ScatterPredictedTarget:CNN}. Moreover, the plots are fairly similar. A higher spread can be observed in the data of \acs{poop}-\acs{cnn}. The model's highest and lowest prediction range seems to be smaller with the lowest value being close to $0.025$ and the largest close to $0.025$ compared to $-0.03.5$, and $0.035$ respectively.

\end{figure}

To give a clearer overview of the predictions, a histogram has also been plotted. The histogram in \autoref{fig:Results:HistogramPredictedTarget} shows a fairly similar range of values between ground truth and targets.
In this plot as well, is shown that the lowest and highest prediction range is limited to bins starting at lower than $-0.04$ and higher than $0.04$. Moreover, predictions of \ac{poop}-\ac{cnn}, can only be found in an even narrower bucket start range which is in the range $[-0.029, 0.021]$. Further, focus values for both models which are zero or slightly below zero are not predicted as often as the ground truth. Focus values that \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 predicts around $-0.029$ and around $0.021$ seem to be present disproportionally often especially compared to the ground truth. This is also the case for values in buckets starting with $0.021$ and $0.029$. \ac{poop}-\ac{cnn} shows similar behaviour, however, the ranges differ slightly as there disproportionally often predictions are in the buckets $-0.021$, $-0.014$ and $0.007$. The general shape of the histogram for \ac{poop}-\ac{cnn} is more asymmetrical than for {poop}-\acs{resnet}-34  and the ground truth. Also, for \acs{poop}-\acs{cnn} negative values seem to be predicted more commonly. The for \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 observed a lower number of predictions in the bucket starting at $0$ and the fairly uniform shape of the histogram is consistent with the higher spread observed close to zero in \autoref{fig:Results:ScatterPredictedTarget:ResNet34}.

\section{Comparison to Traditional Focus Methods}
\label{sec:Results:TraditionalFocusMethods}

The models are also compared to traditional focus methods. The results of this comparison are shown in \autoref{tab:Results:Comparison:RelatedWorks:Accuracy} and \autoref{tab:Results:Comparison:RelatedWorks:IndexMAE}.

\autoref{tab:Results:Comparison:RelatedWorks:Accuracy} shows the accuracy of models when predicting the correct image ($\pm 1$) of a focus stack. Higher accuracy is better. Of note is the high accuracy when using \ac{mdct}. In overall accuracy, \ac{mdct} beats all other traditional methods with a large margin. Further, it reaches a higher result than all neural network-based models except the best performing \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-32. Also, of note should be that of \acs{poop}-\acs{cnn} which reaches an accuracy of $0.71$ and thereby beats most traditional methods (\ac{vol4} and \ac{laplacian}). The worst performing model is \acs{poop}-\acs{fc} followed by \ac{vol4}.

A similar result can be seen in \autoref{tab:Results:Comparison:RelatedWorks:IndexMAE} which, shows \ac{mae}$^*$ of the index. With this metric, a lower error shows a better result. The best performing model is \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 followed by \acs{mdct}. \Acs{mdct} has the lowest error when predicting hookworms, but all other categories are led by \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34. \Acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-18 commonly is off by one image with an error of $0.95$. The same data is also visualized in \autoref{fig:Results:Comparison:RelatedWorks:IndexMAE} as a violin plot. The violin plot shows the maximum error for \ac{mdct} is fairly low. Errors of \ac{mdct} where the index is predicted in the negative direction do not exceed minus one. The positive direction however is off to a larger extent. The overall maximum and minimum errors of \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 are in a similar range, however, more symmetric. Another characteristic that the plot reveals is that the mean of most metrics is close to zero.

\section{Heatmap and Stitched Image Generation}
\label{sec:Results:HeatStiched}

This section contains visualizations of focus stacks and individual images that are all taken from the same focus stack. One image of this focus stack is shown in \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:ImageSliceVisualisation}. Later, \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide} shows slices of different images of the same focus stack. \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:ImageSliceVisualisation} describes where the slices are taken from. The image shown has the stack index 4, when indexing from 0.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/40_results/image_slice_visualisation.pdf}
    \caption[Example focus stack image]{Image of a focus stack and the image slice taken from the image, that is used in \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide}.}
    \label{fig:Results:Stack:ImageSliceVisualisation}
\end{figure}


To get an overview of different focus levels, different image slices of a focus stack are shown in \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide}. The slice of the image contains one egg. The slice where the egg is most in focus is the slice with stack index 4 (\autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide:Index0}). On the other hand, \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide:Index2} shows the background most clearly. This figure shows which features of an image are most in focus across multiple images of a focus stack. A mosaic image that was produced using \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 is shown in \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide:Stiched}. This image is produced by predicting the focus on $150 \times 150$ pixel patches with a stride of $50$ pixels on and then interpolating the result based on overlapping predictions. The mosaic or stitched image mostly leaves the background unfocused, however, some features like a stone (right and upwards of the egg) are shown in focus. Further, the egg seems to stem mostly from the image with index 5 (\autoref{fig:Results:Stack:SideBySide:Index1}). Of note is also, that the picture is produced based on the whole focus stack, not only the images that are shown.

\end{figure}

The properties of distance prediction allow the generation of a heatmap on a whole image taken by a microscope. The heatmap also uses $150 \times 150$ pixels patches with a stride of $50$ pixels. \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:HeatMap} shows a heatmap generated using \acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34 on different images of a focus stack. The heatmaps for the images with the index $3$, $4$ and $5$ are shown in \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:HeatMap:Stack3}, \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:HeatMap:Stack4} and \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:HeatMap:Stack5} respectively. Areas predicted to be in focus are shown in white, areas shown in red are predicted to be off the focus plane in the negative direction and areas in blue in the positive direction. The image with index 3 is dominated by mostly red areas, however, some areas are also coloured light blue and therefore seem to be fairly close to the focal plane. When comparing this to the image with index 4, it is noticeable that the blue coloured areas are darker, thereby showing that they are further away from the ideal focus plane. The red areas are lighter and therefore are closer to being in focus. The image with index 5 contains almost no red, but instead is mostly coloured blue. The highlighted spots are consistent across images and also the predicted distances change in accordance with the index. The last image (\autoref{fig:Results:Stack:HeatMap:Stiched}) shows the heatmap of the stitched image of the whole focus stack. The colouring is least apparent and the visible patterns match that of the other images.

Lastly, \autoref{fig:Results:Stack:ContourPlot} shows a contour plot of the image indices that the model (\acs{poop}-\acs{resnet}-34) predicts to be most in focus. The majority of the image is predicted to be in focus with an index of 4. There are some patches with a predicted index of 5. A similar area is occupied by parts which are predicted to be in focus at index 3. Lastly, at the edges and in the corners some small areas are predicted to be best in focus in the image with index 2.

\section{Speed and Memory Consumption}
\label{sec:Results:Computation}

This section is detailing the hardware needed to run each model. Traditional methods need the least amount of memory and are the fastest overall. \Acl{nn} models need the most additional memory and the memory and computation time increase with model size. The measured speed is shown in  \autoref{tab:Results:Computation:Speed} and \autoref{fig:Results:Computation:Speed}.
The fastest model across all is \ac{vol4} with a runtime per patch of \unit{0.13}{\milli\second} on the \ac{cpu} and \unit{0.11}{\milli\second} on the \ac{gpu}. The fastest method when only considering machine learning models is \ac{poop}-\ac{fc} on the \ac{gpu} and \ac{poop}-\ac{cnn} on the \ac{cpu}. All traditional methods are faster than the machine learning models. Of note is that \ac{poop}-\ac{cnn} is approximately half as fast when compared to the performance of traditional methods, especially \ac{laplacian} and \ac{mdct}. This is the case both on the \ac{cpu} and \ac{gpu}. 

\ac{poop}-\ac{resnet} models do not compare in speed to any of the traditional metrics. They are approximately $10$ to $50$ times slower on the \ac{gpu} (when compared to \ac{laplacian} and \ac{mdct}) and approximately $40$ to $170$ times slower on the \ac{cpu}. Larger \ac{resnet} models increase their runtime fairly linearly with size, especially on the \ac{gpu}. Further, the difference between \ac{cpu} and \ac{gpu} is largest for \ac{poop}-\ac{fc} with a factor of $20$, followed by \ac{resnet} models with a factor of around $10$. The smallest difference between \ac{gpu} and \ac{cpu} is obtained by \ac{vol4}. Overall, traditional methods see the lowest speed difference.
